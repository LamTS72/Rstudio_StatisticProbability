INTRODUCTION:

Assignment for beginners programming with `R studio`  which is a tool supporting Statistic and Probability . If you are studying Mathematics or you want to be 
Data Scientist or Data Engineer, you need to learn `R studio` right now. Beside a basic programming language for DATA is `Python`, `R studio` is strong programming
language to handle DATA in practice.

CONTENTS:

We have 2 parts for you who are interested in STATISTIC AND PROBABILITY WITH R STUDIO. In `part1`, some basic small exercise of computations to practice for beginners 
who are the first time using R. In `part2`, we have 2 big problems about handling data in practice. If you dont understand what we did, please read reports of them which 
are attached on each file.
